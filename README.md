## Welcome to my SQL portfolio!

This code repository showcases various examples of SQL queries and scripts that I have written. Feel free to explore the contents and delve into the intricacies of the SQL language. If you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback and inquiries are always welcome.
